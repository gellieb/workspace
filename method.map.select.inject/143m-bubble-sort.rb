# Implement a Bubble sort in a method #bubble_sort
# that takes an Array and modifies it so that it is in sorted order.

# Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is 
# a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through
# the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and
# swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the
# list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the
# list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller
# elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses
# comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison
# sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most other algorithms are
# more efficient for sorting large lists.
