## Website Design and Development Process

_The basics:_

1. Information gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

### Phase One: Information Gathering

The first step is actually the most important one: **have a good understanding of** ***you***-- what your business goals and dreams are, and how the web can be utilized to help you achieve those goals. Then the web designer can start off by asking a lot of questions to help them understand your business and your needs in a web site.

Consider: 
* **Purpose** 
    * What is the purpose of the site? Do you want to provide info, promote a service, sell a product...?
* **Goals**
    * What do you hope to accomplish by building this site? Two of the more common goals are either to make money or share information.
* **Target audience**
    * Is there a specific group of people that will help you reach your goals? It is helpful to picture the "ideal" person you want to visit your web site. Consider their age, sex, or interests -- who is your client? This will later help determine the best design style for your site.
* **Content** 
    * What kind of information will the target audience be looking for on your site? Are they looking for specific information, a particular product or service, online ordering...?


### Phase two: Planning

Using the information gathered from phase 1, a site map can be developed.

The site map is a list of all the main topic areas of the site, as well as subtopics, if applicable. This serves as a guide as to what content will be on the site, and is essential to developing a consistent, easy to understand navigational system. 

The end-user of the site (the customer) must be kept in mind when designing your site. A good user interface creates an easy to navigate web site, and is the basis for people learning about your service or buying your product.

During the planning process, your web designer will also help you decide what technologies should be implemented. Elements such as what CMS (content management system) such as *WordPress* to incorporate, will any contact forms be needed, etc. are discussed when planning your web site.


### Phase three: Design

Drawing from the information gathered up to this point, it's time to determine the look and feel of your site.

Target audience is one of the key factors taken into consideration. A site aimed at teenagers, for example, will look much different than one meant for a financial institution. As part of the design phase, it is also important to incorporate elements such as the company logo or colors to help strengthen the identity of your company on the web site.

The web designer will create one or more prototype designs for your web site -- a .jpg image of what the final design will look like. The designer should allow the client to view the project throughout the design and development stages so that it gives the client the opportunity to express his likes/dislikes on the design.

Communication in this phase is crucial.

### Phase four: Development

This is the developmental stage in which the web site itself is created. 

This is typically done by first developing the home page, followed by a "shell" for the inferior pages. The shell serves as a template for the content pages of your site; it contains the main navigational structure for the web site. Once the shell has been created, the designer will take the content and distribute it throughout the site, in the appropriate areas.

Elements such as the CMS (ie. WordPress), interactive contact forms, or ecommerce shopping carts are implemented and made functional during this phase. On the technical front, a successful web site requires an understanding of front-end web development This involves writing valid HTML/CSS code that complies to current web standards, maximizing functionality, as well as accessibility for as large an audience as possible.


### Phase five: Testing and Delivery

At this point, testing things such as the complete functionality of forms or other scripts, as well as last testing for last minute compatibility issues, ensuring your site optimal viewing in browsers.

Valid code means that your site meets the current web development standards-- this is helpful when checking for issues such as cross-browser compatibility.

Once the designer gets final approval, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program is used to upload the web site files to your server. Some designers offer domain name registration and web hosting servies as well or have recommendatoins as to where you can host your site.

Other final details include plugin installation (for WordPress or other CMS driven web sites and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)). SEO is the optimizatoin of your web site with elements such as title, description and keyword tags which help your web stie achieve higher rankings in search engines. The previously mentioned code validation is something that plays a vital rold in SEO, as well. There are many WordPress plugins available that further enhance the default WordPress functionality -- many of which directly relate to improving your SEO, as well.


### Phase six: Maintenance

One way to bring repeat visitors to your site is to offer new content or products on a regular basis. Most web designers will be more than happy to continue working together with you, to update the information on your web site. 

A web site driven by a CMS gives you the ability to edit the content areas of the website yourself. You are given access to a back-end administrative area, where you can use an online text editor. You will be able to edit existing content this way, or if more adventurous, you can even add new pages and content yourself. The possibilities are endless!
