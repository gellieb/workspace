##Definitions

+ **greedy algorithm:** is a mathematical process that looks for simple, easy-to-implement solutions to complex, multistep problems by deciding which next step will provide the most obvious benefit. 
    + "Why are such algorithms called greedy?": while the optimum solution to each smaller instance will provide an immediate output, the algorithm doesn't consider the larger problem as a whole. Once a decision has been made, it is never reconsidered.
    + Greedy algorithms work by recursively constructing a set of objects from the smallest possible constituent parts. Recursion is an approach to problem solving in which the solution to a particular problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. The advantage to using a greedy algorithm is that solutions to smaller instances of the problem can be straightforward and easy to understand. The disadvantage is that it is entirely possible that the most optimal short-term solutions may lead to the worst possible long-term outcome.
