How to attack a problem.
1. write in the problem test first "puts method()" etc.. at the bottom
2. scaffold the method
3. Figure out line by line. Use IRB as much as possible to test bits of code (big chunks of new code is harder to debug). Log as often as you can as well to test stuff - depending on how complex the problem is.
4. break out complexity into separate methods
