# Towers of Hanoi

# Write a Towers of Hanoi game  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_hanoi 

# Keep three arrays, which represents the piles of discs. Pick a
# representation of the discs to store in the arrays; maybe just a
# number representing their size.

# In a loop, prompt the user (using gets)
# and ask what pile to select a disc from, and where to put it.

# After each move, check to see if they have succeeded in moving 
# all the discs, to the final pile. If so, they win!

# HINT: Do a LOT of IRB or PRY in order to figure out proper way to maneuver through hashes.
