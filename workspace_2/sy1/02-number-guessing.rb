# Create a game that gives a user three chances to guess
# a number that the program has randomly generated between
# 1 and 50. The user wins when the user guesses correctly 
# and the game promptly ends. 

# Each time a guess is incorrect, 
# the program will generously provide a hint and suggest the
# user to choose a higher or lower number for the next guess. 
# If the user fails all three guesses, then the user loses and 
# the program tells the user what the correct number was. 

# For the last guess, the program will be even more generous 
# and accept a close-enough guess that is off by 1. For example
# a last guess of 15 wins if the actual number was 16.
