# That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you could do 
# better. Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. 
# Youâ€™ll have to use return to exit from the loop. 
# (Well, it will get you out of the whole method, but it will 
# get you out of the loop in the process.) How do you like 
# the resulting method? I usually try to avoid using return 
# (a personal preference), but I might make an exception here.
