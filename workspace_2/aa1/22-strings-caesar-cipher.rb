# Caesar cipher

# Implement a Caesar cipher (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).
# Example:  caesar("hello", 3) # => "khoor"

# Assume the text is all lower case letters.
# You'll probably want to map letters to numbers (so you can shift
# them). You can do this mapping yourself, but you may also want to
# use the ASCII codes (wiki-ascii), which are accessible through
# String#each_byte.

# You will probably also want to use String#ord and Fixnum#chr.
# Important point: ASCII codes are all consecutive!
# Be careful of the letters at the end of the alphabet, like "z"!
