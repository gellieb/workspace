# Estimated time for THREE Methods (functions) Exercises: 1hr

# Implement a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The method `rps` should 
# take a string (either "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors") as a 
# parameter and return the computer's choice, and the outcome of 
# the match. Example:

# rps("Rock") # => "Paper, Lose"
# rps("Scissors") # => "Scissors, Draw"
# rps("Scissors") # => "Paper, Win"
