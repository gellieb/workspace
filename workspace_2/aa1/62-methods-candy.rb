# Estimated time for THREE Methods (functions) Exercises: 1hr

# Implement a Candy game. The method `candy_pairer` should take an
# array of candy-child pair arrays and return the same type of data structure,
# with the candy-child pair mixed up. Assume that the first item in the candy-child
# array is a candy, and the second item is a child. Don't pair a candy
# to a candy. An example run of the program:

candy_pairer([
  ["Snickers", "Pete"],
  ["Mars", "Jane"],
  ["Gummy Bears", "Tim"]
])
