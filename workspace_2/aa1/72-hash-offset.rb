# Estimated total time for all THREE Hash Exercises: 30min

# Hash offset

# Martha has created a hash with letter symbols as keys to represent 
# items that start with their keys. However, she realized everything 
# is off by one letter.

# wrong_hash = { :a => "banana", :b => "cabbage", :c => "dental_floss", :d => "eel_sushi" }

# Write a program hash_correct that takes this wrong hash and returns 
# the correct one.
